🩺 MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTOR
🧠 About the Project 
A machine learning-based web app that predicts multiple diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Breast Cancer, and Parkinson's based on user-provided health information.

🎯 Objective:
To create a unified and user-friendly platform that uses trained ML models to predict the chances of multiple diseases using clinical data, improving early diagnosis and awareness.

🧬 Supported Diseases & Inputs:
Disease	Key Input Features
Diabetes	Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, Insulin, Skin Thickness
Heart Disease	Age, Chest Pain, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, ECG, Heart Rate
Breast Cancer	Mean Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness
Parkinson's Disease	MDVP Features (Fo, Jitter, Shimmer, NHR, HNR, etc.)

📦 Tech Stack:
Language: Python

ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Web Framework: Streamlit

Model Saving: Pickle

UI Styling: CSS (custom styling for Streamlit)

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud 

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Each disease has its own trained model.

🖥️ App Features:
Sidebar menu to choose disease

Form with health-related input fields

Predict button to evaluate risk

Result message with color indicator (e.g., green: safe, red: risk)

Optional: Health tips, graphs, or reports
